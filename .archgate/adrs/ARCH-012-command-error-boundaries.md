# Command Error Boundaries

## Context

Async command actions that lack try-catch error boundaries produce poor user experiences when they fail. Without explicit error handling:

1. Errors propagate to the top-level `main().catch()` in `cli.ts`, which exits with code 2 (internal error) and shows only the raw error message
2. Users cannot distinguish between a command failure (code 1) and a CLI bug (code 2)
3. Error messages lack context about what the command was trying to do

This was discovered during a repository-wide review where `review-context`, `session-context claude-code`, and `session-context cursor` all lacked error boundaries.

ARCH-002 defines the exit code convention and logging patterns, but does not require error boundaries in command actions. This ADR complements ARCH-002 by making error boundaries mandatory.

**Why not a global Commander.js error handler?** Commander provides `.exitOverride()` and `.configureOutput()` for parsing errors (unknown options, missing arguments), but these do **not** cover errors thrown inside async `.action()` callbacks. Commander's `preAction`/`postAction` hooks could theoretically wrap actions, but they don't catch async errors from the action body. The `main().catch()` in `cli.ts` catches unhandled rejections as a safety net (exit 2), but per-command try-catch is needed to produce contextual error messages and exit with code 1 instead of 2.

## Decision

Every async command action MUST wrap its body in a try-catch block that:

1. Catches errors from async operations
2. Formats them with `logError()` from `src/helpers/log.ts`
3. Exits with code 1 (expected failure) for user-facing errors

The top-level `main().catch()` in `cli.ts` remains as a safety net for truly unexpected errors (code 2), but it should never be the primary error handler for commands.

**Pattern:**

```typescript
.action(async (opts) => {
  try {
    // command logic
  } catch (err) {
    logError(err instanceof Error ? err.message : String(err));
    process.exit(1);
  }
});
```

**Exceptions:**

- Synchronous command actions (e.g., `clean`) that cannot throw async errors
- Command group index files that only register subcommands

## Do's and Don'ts

### Do

- Wrap every async command action body in a try-catch
- Use `logError()` for error messages in the catch block
- Exit with code 1 for expected failures

### Don't

- Don't rely on `main().catch()` as the only error handler for commands
- Don't catch and silently swallow errors — always log them
- Don't exit with code 2 in command catch blocks — that code is reserved for unexpected crashes

## Consequences

### Positive

- Users see contextual error messages instead of raw exception text
- Exit code 1 vs 2 distinction is preserved — scripts and CI can differentiate
- Every command handles its own failures gracefully

### Negative

- Minor boilerplate in every async command action

## Compliance and Enforcement

### Automated Enforcement

- **Archgate rule** `ARCH-012/async-action-error-boundary`: Scans async command actions for try-catch blocks. Severity: `warning` (some commands may have valid reasons for alternative patterns).

### Manual Enforcement

Code reviewers MUST verify that new async commands include error boundaries.
